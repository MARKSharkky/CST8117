The collateral for lab 5 which includes an academic conference paper to format, 
including the footnotes to link properly. And a disco ball animated gif for use
in the party invitation. 

This lab consists of three small web pages, each requiring a different kind of
design focus: A party invitation page, a COVID safety information page, and an
academic paper (formal).
